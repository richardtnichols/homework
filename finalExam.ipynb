    "1\\.  \"In 2007, a university study was published investigating the crash risk of alcohol impaired driving. Data from 2,871 crashes were used to measure the association of a personâ€™s blood alcohol level (BAC) with the risk of being in an accident. The table below shows results from the study.[1] The relative risk is a measure of how many times more likely a person is to crash. So, for example, a person with a BAC of 0.09 is 3.54 times as likely to crash as a person who has not been drinking alcohol.\"[2]\n",

    "2\\.  This problem will illustrate a phenomenon called Simpson's paradox in probability and statistics in which a trend appears in several groups of data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined.  The data below give a treatment type of A or B, a condition type of 1 or 2, and a response to treatment which is a number between -2 and 10.  Lower numbers show less response to treatment and larger numbers show more response to treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Produce two separate graphics of the data.  The first should give two box plots, one showing responses for all treatment A and the other showing responses for all treatment B.  Give the graphic a title of \"Responses by treatment only.\"  The y-axis should be labeled Response and each box plot should indicate which treatment is being plotted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second should give four box plots, the first showing responses for treatment A and condition 1, the second showing responses for treatment B and condition 1, the third showing responses for treatment A and condition 2, and the fourth showing responses for treatment B and condition 2.  Give the graphic a title of \"Responses by treatment and condition.\"  The y-axis should be labeled Response and each box plot should indicate which treatment is being plotted.\n",
